	  <notes>Dual Pistol Firing (One-Handed Firearm Only): Also known as the Way of John Woo, this technique allows a character to fire two one-handed weapons at once. The weapons do not need to be identical, but must fire with the same fire mode selected. The attack is resolved as a single attack from one weapon. Use the worse DV, AP,  Accuracy, Dice Pool, Recoil Compensation, Range, Defense Penalty of the two-weapons after all other effects are determined. After these values are determined the characters adds +1 DV and +1 Accuracy to the attack. Both weapons are considered to have fired the full number of rounds for the burst for the purposes of ammo consumption, but the character only takes recoil as if only one fired.</notes>
